## What is it?

If you work with React, you know that the library enables you to manage and use your icons in a lot a ways. This is good because you have flexibility to manage them as you want. So, in many cases this workflow can become a manual and massive process that you need to do so many times.

Reicons is a simple CLI tool that helps you to manage and use your icons quickly and easily.

## ðŸ‘Œ Advantages

- [x] Require your icons as a simple React component
- [x] Customize your icons with just css or inline styles
- [x] Resize them in a prop way
- [x] No `.svg`, `.png` or `.jpg` inside your bundle

That's great no? See more information above about how to use!

## ðŸ”Œ Install

The first thing that you need to do to use Reicons is install it globally or as a dependency at your project:

```bash
$ yarn [global] add reicons
```

After that you can see it working:

```bash
$ reicons --help

reicons -p [<package-dir:package-prefix>] -s <dir> -b <dir>

Options:
  --version       Show version number                     [boolean]
  --packages, -p  Your svg icons packages                 [array]
  --src, -s       Directory with the icons folder         [string]
  --build, -b     Build directory                         [string]
  --help          Show help                               [boolean]
```

## ðŸ’» Example

Let's use the [default example folder](./example/default) as example. There's we have an `images` folder that have two folders [font-awesome](./example/default/font-awesome) and [icons](./example/default/icons) with a lot of svg files inside. So, we want to build our components at folder `components/Icons`. To do that, we can run:

```bash
$ cd example/default
$ reicons -p font-awesome:fa icons:ic -s images -b components/Icons
```

After we this command, Reicons will generate our components in a folder structure like that:

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ components
â””â”€â”€ images
    â”œâ”€â”€ font-awesome
    â””â”€â”€ icons
```

If we look at `components` folder we have a lot of bundled components separated by prefix:

```bash.
.
â””â”€â”€ components
 Â Â  â””â”€â”€ Icons
 Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ Fa
 Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ Book.js
 Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ CreditCard.js
 Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ GithubLogo.js
 Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ Ic
 Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ Home.js
 Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ Location.js
 Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ Search.js
 Â Â      â””â”€â”€ index.js
```

Your bundled icon will be something like that:

```jsx
import React, { PropTypes } from 'react';

const FaBook = ({ className, size, style }) =>
  <svg
    width={size}
    height={size}
    viewBox="0 0 475.452 475.452"
    style={{ ...style, width: size, height: size }}
    className={`${className ? className + ' ' : ''}Icon Icon--FaBook`}>
    <path d="/* the svg path string */" />
  </svg>;

FaBook.propTypes = {
  className: PropTypes.string,
  size: PropTypes.number,
  style: PropTypes.object
};

FaBook.defaultProps = {
  size: 25
};

export default FaBook;
```

## âš™ Usage

You need to know just few things to use the tool. As you've seen above, Reicons need to read a list of svg icons and know where you want to bundle your components.

So, to bundle your icons you need to pass three arguments: `--package`, `--src` and `--build`.

### `--package`

One or more packages that you will use as icons. This argument has a default style to write, because we need it to find and create your svg files.

The default style to write your package is: `<package-directory>:<package-prefix>`

The `package-directory` is the folder name of your svg icons and the `package-prefix` is the name that we will use to prefix your components.

### `--src`

The source directory when your packages folder is.

### `--build`

The build directory when you want to create your components.
